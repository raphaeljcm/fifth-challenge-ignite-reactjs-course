## ðŸ’» About the challenge

In this challenge, I had to create an application from total 0, only with a Figma layout to guide me. The application is a blog that I had to connect with Prismic CMS. ðŸ”¥
This challenge was definitely a great one, I learned a lot building this application, Rocketseat never disappoints me.
